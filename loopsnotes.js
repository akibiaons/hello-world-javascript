/*
- Loops allow for us to create a set of instructions to be run until a certain condition is met.
- Loops allow us developers to create scalable, manageable, and efficent JavaScript programs. 
*/

//LESSON 1: Repeating Tasks Manually
/*
- Before making loops we must understand that writing the same code over and over agin can vbe tiring as seen below:
*/

const cities = ['San Diego', 'Bakersfeild', 'San Fransisco', 'Los Angeles'];
console.log(cities[0]);
console.log(cities[1]);
console.log(cities[2]);
console.log(cities[3]);
// Above I console.log(cities[index]); for each and every indexed element. This is a tiresome and non scalable way of programming with JavaScript.
